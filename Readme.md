The challenge consists of exploring the content of the data with visualizations and descriptive statistics (univariate / multivariate)
setting up a predictive model i.e :

- partition your data via train test split
- either learn to predict price (regression task) or learn to predict brand (classification task)
- evaluate your modelsâ€™ performance comparing your favorite algorithms
